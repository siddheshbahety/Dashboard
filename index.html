        <h2>Why we need to be sustainable</h2>
        <p>
            As an aquaculture feed company with a global presence, Skretting is ideally positioned to contribute towards 
            the development of more sustainable food production. By 2050, the world population will have grown to almost 
            10 billion people. At the same time, increased urbanisation and income growth are changing dietary preferences 
            and increasing the demand for animal proteins. Through our purpose of feeding the future, we are committed to 
            producing feeds that provide food security in a sustainable way. At Skretting, we have a strong focus on reducing 
            our environmental footprint and increasing our positive social impact. Our objectives are aligned with the 
            long-term goals of our strategy as well as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the scale of the sustainability challenges facing the world, it is impossible to achieve progress in isolation. 
            This can only be achieved if partnerships are formed between all segments of society including business, government, 
            NGOs, and communities. Collaboration is one of our company values at Skretting and Nutreco and this can be seen 
            through our long-term involvement in external partnerships and multistakeholder platforms. This includes our biannual 
            Agri and AquaVision conferences as well as the Pincoy Project in Chile, the Seafood Business Ocean Stewardship, and our 
            community development projects in Nigeria, Fjordfrende in Norway, and Aqua in Bocca in Italy, to name a few.
